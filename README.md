## Description
I created a VR Snake game. Utilising javascript and A-Frame to get things working. This game is PWA compatible so I'm hoping one day when Meta fully integrate PWA apps that this will be easily included! This is a project has made me a better and HTML formatting & using JavaScript. There is a small to-do list, but this is a funny functional product. Feel free to play this game at https://jadegamesuk.netlify.app/ either in VR ü•Ω or on your computer üíªüñ•Ô∏è
